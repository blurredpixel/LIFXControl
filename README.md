# LIFXControl
Python utility to control LIFX Lights

This is a basic controller that is still being updated with functionality for LIFX smart lights. I have also implemented a very basic GUI
to use the functions of the controller. Very limited testing. 

You'll need the appjar and requests modules for this to run. You'll also need to create an API token with LIFX Lights.

Features:
*On/Off Switch
*Brightness Slider(can only go min or max brightness for right now)

Coming soon:
*Basic color selection
*proper brightness adjustment
*room control
